projectName: Chinese Temples in Bangkok

description: |
  Starting out as a follow-up study of W. Franke's documentation of Chinese Epigraphy in Bangkok, this survey maps more than 199 Chinese temple sites. It does not include small roadside shrines. The vast majority of the temples are freestanding buildings with doors and opening hours. The survey builds on previous lists. However, none of these were geo-referenced nor did they (with the exception of Pornpan-Mak 1994 and Duan 1996) include Chinese characters. The lists cited in the `.yaml` include:

  * **CSFB** : Number of the temple in the appendix of "Chinese Shrines - The Faith of Bangkok" (2016)
  * **CSFBmainText** : There is a longer description of the temple in the main text of "ศาลเจ้า ศรัทธา สถาน แห่ง บางกอก Chinese Shrines - The Faith of Bangkok" (2016)
  * **CGBappendix** : Number of the temple in the appendix of "เทพเจ้าจีนในกรุงเทพฯ [Chinese Gods in Bangkok]" (2022)

  * **DuanNo**: Number of the temple in Duan, Lisheng. 1996. 段立生. 1996. Taiguo de zhongshi simiao 泰國的中式寺廟 [The Chinese temples of Thailand]. Bangkok: Pin Yo Printing.

  The survey was conducted 2022-2023. Currently the test set contains only 100 sites.
