  ## Survey of Chinese Temples in Bangkok (2022-2023)

  Starting out as a follow-up study of W. Franke's documentation of Chinese Epigraphy in Bangkok, this survey maps more than 170 Chinese temple sites. It does not include small roadside shrines. The vast majority of the temples are freestanding buildings with doors and opening hours. The survey builds on previous lists. However, none of these were geo-referenced nor did they (with the exception of Duan 1996) include Chinese characters.
  The survey was done 2022-2023. Currently the test set contains only 100 sites.
